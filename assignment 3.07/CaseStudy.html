          Routinery is a mobile app that has an animated orange named, Mandy. Mandy helps the user navigate the app and makes it more fun, helping them set new goals and tasks for each day whether they are long-term or short-term. In this app, there are features where the user gets to choose a good, new habit to attempt to complete, there is a breathing and brain break feature and a journaling feature. This makes it possible for the user to not only create good habits and reach their goals while being productive but also help the user have a better mental state, which is very important in reducing procrastination.
          </h3>
          <h1>effectiveness claim:</h1>
          <h3>Routinery helps the user become aware of the bad habits they have when it comes to procrastination. It asks the user how they feel depending on the day, and they set goals on that. So, by helping the user create these new things, they will be able to reach their goals and get closer to it. 
          </h3>
          <h1>use of technology claim:</h1>
          <h3>Routinery is a mobile app that is made for the general public. The creators of this app are engineers and individuals who specialize in design and not many scientists or people who specialize in psychology, so it may not be very scientifically accurate for helping users build habits.
          </h3>
          <h1>implications:</h1>
          <h3>An implication for my real project is that it would be better if I talked to a science teacher or someone who is doing research on procrastination and how the brain works around that to better help and understand my target audience.</h3>
