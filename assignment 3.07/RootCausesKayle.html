              <h1> root cause #1: students procrastinate because of task aversiveness. they find assignments boring or unpleasant to complete because they are distracted by other things.  </h1>
              <h3> evidence 1. Steel (2007) also
                concluded that task aversiveness, or decreasing the value of a task, increases the
                frequency of procrastination. Procrastinators tend to be impulsive, distractible, and 
                3, lacking in self-control. </h3>
              <h3> explanation: students do not see academics as a priority, so they tend to put it off.
                when they try to do their work, it results in failing to complete assignments because
                their brain wires them to want them to do something else.
              </h3>
              <h3> evidence 2. students' procrastination behavior was further related to high
                 levels of task aversiveness due to a perceived lack of control and uncertainty
                  about how to proceed (Blunt & Pychyl, 2000). Accordingly, procrastination behavior should be more likely to occur when an individual experiences uncertainty about the actions or the means required to accomplish one's task successfully.</h2>
              <h3> explanation. when students do not understand the assignments they complete or they do not find them "fun", they most likely will not complete it. they use other things to distract themselves from completing their assignments, which becomes a habit </h3>
              <h3> implications. procrastinators are not voluntarily procrastinating so they must take this into account. Being distracted and not having self-control is something that a procrastinator has as a habit.
              </h3>
              <h1> root cause #2: students procrastinate because they feel overwhelmed. most students are already occupied with other life matters, and piled assignments on top of this causes a student to want to avoid them.
              </h1>
              <h3> evidence 1. "Procrastination is not a matter, solely, of having poor time management skills, either, but rather can be traced to underlying and more complex psychological reasons. These dynamics are often made worse by schools where students are constantly being evaluated, and especially in college where the pressure for grades is high and a lot can be riding on students' performance. In reality, procrastination is often a self-protection strategy for students." </h3>
              <h3> explanation. being overwhelmed with life obligations, classes, and other things like familial matters can cause a student to put off their assignments. they may have other priorities </H3>
              <h3> evidence 2. " The bad news is that procrastination usually aggravates the feeling of overwhelm and avoidance, which causes the accumulation of more work and a cycle of doom that feeds off itself."</h3>
              <h3> explanation. students are busy with other things, so they tend to avoid schoolwork, and it becomes a cycle. or it may be that because there is so much work to do, they may feel so overwhelmed that they avoid it.
              <h3> implications. procrastinators might just have many other obligations and afterschool or familial matters that they need to tend to and they might just be tired or mentally exhuasted</h3>
              </h3>
